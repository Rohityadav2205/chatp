Explanation of code:-

response = openai.Completion.create(: This line initiates the API call to OpenAI's Completion API and assigns the response to the response variable.

engine='text-davinci-003',: The engine parameter specifies which language model to use for text completion. In this case, it's set to 'text-davinci-003', which represents a specific version or variant of the language model.

prompt=question,: The prompt parameter contains the text or question that will be used as the input for text completion. The value is to be assigned from a variable named question.

max_tokens=50,: The max_tokens parameter sets the maximum number of tokens the generated completion should have. Tokens are chunks of text, and limiting them can control the length of the generated response.

n=1,: The n parameter specifies the number of completions to generate. In this case, it is set to 1, so only one completion will be returned.

stop=None,: The stop parameter can be used to specify a sequence of tokens at which text generation should stop. Setting it to None means that text generation will continue until the maximum number of tokens is reached.

temperature=0.7,: The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated output. Higher values, such as 0.7, make the output more diverse and creative, while lower values make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p=None,: The top_p parameter, also known as nucleus sampling or "p-Top K" sampling, constrains the generated output to the most likely tokens until a cumulative probability (specified by top_p) is reached. Setting it to None means it's not explicitly used in this code.

frequency_penalty=0.6,: The frequency_penalty parameter adjusts the penalty for frequently used tokens during text generation. A higher value, such as 0.6, encourages the model to explore less common or repetitive choices.

presence_penalty=0.6: The presence_penalty parameter adjusts the penalty for tokens already present in the prompt. A higher value, such as 0.6, encourages the model to generate responses that are more distinct from the input prompt.
